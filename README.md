## PCB etching in a new way: compact, efficient, affordable!

We present to you a project created within the framework of the Pacific Project School of the Department of Pre-University Education, Far Eastern Federal University: a device for etching boards in ferric chloride solution.

### What makes our device special?

- Fully sealed vessel: Prevents solution evaporation and ensures safe operation.
- Precise temperature control: A PI controller based on Arduino Nano provides stable and set etching temperature.
- Energy efficiency: The device operates from a standard network and consumes minimal energy.
- Ease of use: Simply choose the desired temperature using the encoder, and the device will begin working.
- Modularity: You can easily adjust the size and power of the device to suit your needs.

### Advantages of our device:

- Affordable price: Starting from just 5000 rubles, significantly cheaper than ready-made solutions on the market.
- High efficiency: Precise temperature control and a sealed vessel ensure optimal conditions for etching boards.
- Safety: The sealed design eliminates contact with the solution and ensures safe operation.
- Versatility: Suitable for both home hobbyists and small productions.
